## Situational Analysis

### Situation

In 2019, fire in commercial premises accounted for 8.4% of the total incident count.
This is due to large areas & the premises being highly populated, thus difficulty in crowd control management during emergency. Occupants of commercial premises are less aware of evacuation plans, leading to higher chances of entrapment in the event of a fire.
