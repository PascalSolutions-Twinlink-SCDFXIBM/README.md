## Situational Analysis

### Situation

In 2019, fire in commercial premises accounted for 8.4% of the total incident count.
This is due to large areas & the premises being highly populated, thus difficulty in crowd control management during emergency. Occupants of commercial premises are less aware of evacuation plans, leading to higher chances of entrapment in the event of a fire.

Current fire-incident guideline for building fire safety managers:

### Key Issues

**Single Point of Information** - Fire alarm systems are triggered with singular inputs from glass alarm, heat/smoke detector or sprinkler system. This leads to **High False Alarm Rate**.

**Reporting Lag-time** - Wardens or any public informants may not spot fire in time before the situation escalates. This leads to **Low Success Rate in Community Response**.

**Lack of Critical Context Information** - Fire safety personnel do not have access to critical information on the occupants in the danger zone to supplement rescue efforts. This leads to **High Fire Injury or Fatality Rate**.


## Strategy and Recommendations

**Twinlink**, an AI-enabled solution built on IBM infrastructure with **3 CORE FEATURES** to provide more timely and precise emergency responses

**Wardens.ai** - Using IBM Watson, we train digital wardens to provide instantaneous situation reports upon any inputs from local IoT sensors
**Twinlink Rapidview** - We pinpoint real-time positions of occupants on digital-twin building layout for responders
**Twinlink Access** - We provide key data for SCDF to analyze the severity of incidents and efficiently allocate EMS resources
